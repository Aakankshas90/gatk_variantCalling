## Meaning of the read group fields required by GATK
    ID = Read group identifier
    LB = DNA preparation library identifier
      MarkDuplicates uses the LB field to determine which read groups might contain molecular duplicates, in case the same DNA library was sequenced on multiple lanes.
    PL = Platform/technology used to produce the read
      This constitutes the only way to know what sequencing technology was used to generate the sequencing data. Valid values: ILLUMINA, SOLID, LS454, HELICOS and PACBIO.
    PU = Platform Unit
    SM = Sample

# To see read group in a bam file
samtools view -H 153-24_gatk.bam | grep '^@RG'
